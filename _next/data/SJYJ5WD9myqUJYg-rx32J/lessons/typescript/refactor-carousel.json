Here we&#39;re telling it what its state and props will look like. We start the interfaces off with a capital I because this signifies that this is an interface. This is a common pattern and one TSLint enforced but ESLint doesn&#39;t by default. I&#39;m showing you so you can make your own call.</li>\n<li>We could specify an <code>IState</code> as well as a second parameter to the <code>Component</code> generic but since we have the <code>state = {}</code> it can infer that without us doing that.</li>\n<li>We need to type the event type coming back from the DOM. We know it&#39;ll come from an HTML element, and we have to make sure it&#39;s not a generic window event. TypeScript forces a lot of this defensive programming.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Carousel is done.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>üèÅ <a href=\"https://github.com/btholt/citr-v8-project/tree/master/typescript-2\">Click here to see the state of the project up until now: typescript-2</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n","slug":"refactor-carousel","title":"Refactor Carousel","section":"TypeScript","icon":"pencil-ruler","filePath":"/home/runner/work/complete-intro-to-react-v8/complete-intro-to-react-v8/lessons/13-typescript/F-refactor-carousel.md","nextSlug":"/lessons/typescript/refactor-pet","prevSlug":"/lessons/typescript/refactor-error-boundary"}},"__N_SSG":true}
