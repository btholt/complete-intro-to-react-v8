See Brian use Tailwind to quickly throw together a responsive grid layout"},"html":"<p>This is probably what most sold me on Tailwind CSS. Let&#39;s say we want to make a nice sort of tiled layout for our search results for our pets. Tailwind makes this so easy. Head to Results.jsx and let&#39;s see this.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-javascript\"><span class=\"hljs-comment\">// replace outermost div</span>\n&lt;div className=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;grid gap-4 grid-cols-2&quot;</span>&gt;[â€¦]&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>lol what</p>\n<p>That just feels like it&#39;s cheating, right? Wow.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>grid</code> puts you into <code>display: grid</code>.</li>\n<li><code>gap-4</code> gives you the gutters between with the number representing how big.</li>\n<li><code>grid-cols-2</code> says how many you want per row.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But we&#39;re not done here. Let&#39;s make it <em>responsive</em> too.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-javascript\">&lt;div className=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;grid gap-4 grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3&quot;</span>&gt;[â€¦]&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>ðŸ¤¯</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>sm:</code> is the small breakpoint which is larger than 640px apply this style (these can be adjusted and renamed)</li>\n<li>The <code>lg:</code> is the large breakpoint is larger than 1024px. There&#39;s also md, xl, and 2xl too.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We just did a fully responsive grid layout with no work. My much younger self is very upset by how much work I had to put into doing this right. This is so much easier than it used to be.</p>\n","slug":"grid-and-breakpoints","title":"Grid and Breakpoints","section":"TailwindCSS","icon":"wind","filePath":"/home/runner/work/complete-intro-to-react-v8/complete-intro-to-react-v8/lessons/10-tailwindcss/E-grid-and-breakpoints.md","nextSlug":"/lessons/tailwindcss/positioning","prevSlug":"/lessons/tailwindcss/apply"}},"__N_SSG":true}
