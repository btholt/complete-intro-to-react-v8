{"pageProps":{"post":{"attributes":{"title":"Welcome to Intermediate React v5","description":"Brian introduces you to Intermediate React v5 and explains how the course is structured."},"html":"<p>Welcome to Intermediate React v5 as taught by Brian Holt</p>\n<p>If you haven&#39;t yet, read the <a href=\"https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-react-v6/intro\">intro page</a> as it explains well who I am, why I&#39;m teaching this course, and what my background is.</p>\n<p>This course is structured a bit different than the Complete Intro to React v8. Whereas the Intro class is a project based class and the whole class builds on one continuous project, this one takes a bunch of unrelated concepts and teaches them as little modules. Feel free to skip modules that don&#39;t apply to you.</p>\n<p>All project files are here: <a href=\"https://github.com/btholt/citr-v8-project/\">citr-v8-project</a>. This is where you&#39;ll find all the various solutions and steps to different parts of the project.</p>\n<p>Specifically, most modules will work on a fresh copy of <a href=\"https://github.com/btholt/citr-v8-project/tree/master/14-context\">the 14-context folder</a>. This folder is the completed project from the Complete Intro to React v8. After each module, we&#39;ll restart with a fresh copy of this folder (i.e. the modules <strong>do not</strong> build on each other.)</p>\n<p>Alright! Let&#39;s have some fun with Intermdiate React v5!</p>\n","slug":"welcome-to-intermediate-react-v5","title":"Welcome to Intermediate React v5","section":"Intermediate React v5","icon":"info-circle","filePath":"/home/runner/work/complete-intro-to-react-v8/complete-intro-to-react-v8/lessons/08-intermediate-react-v5/A-welcome-to-intermediate-react-v5.md","nextSlug":"/lessons/hooks-in-depth/useref","prevSlug":"/lessons/end-of-intro/ways-to-expand-your-app"}},"__N_SSG":true}
