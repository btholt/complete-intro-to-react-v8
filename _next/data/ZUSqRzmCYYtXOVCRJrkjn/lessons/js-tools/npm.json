{"pageProps":{"post":{"attributes":{"title":"npm","description":"When putting any sort of JavaScript project together, npm is an essential tool. Brian talks about how to get started with npm."},"html":"<h2 id=\"npm\">npm</h2>\n<p>npm does not stand for Node.js Package Manager. It is, however, the package manager for Node.js. (They don&#39;t say what it stands for.) It also has all the packages in the front end scene. npm makes a command line tool, called <code>npm</code> as well. <code>npm</code> allows you to bring in code from the npm registry which is a bunch of open source modules that people have written so you can use them in your project. Whenever you run <code>npm install react</code> (don&#39;t do this yet), it will install the latest version of React from the registry.</p>\n<p>In order to start an npm project, run <code>npm init -y</code> at the root of your project. If you don&#39;t have Node.js installed, please go install that too. When you run <code>npm init</code> it&#39;ll ask you a bunch of questions. If you don&#39;t know the answer or don&#39;t care, just hit enter. You can always modify package.json later. This will allow us to get started installing and saving packages.</p>\n","slug":"npm","title":"npm","section":"JS Tools","icon":"hammer","filePath":"/home/runner/work/complete-intro-to-react-v8/complete-intro-to-react-v8/lessons/03-js-tools/A-npm.md","nextSlug":"/lessons/js-tools/prettier","prevSlug":"/lessons/no-frills-react/components"}},"__N_SSG":true}
