If you haven&#39;t, be sure to initialize your project as a git repo with <code>git init</code> in the root of your project (VSCode and any other number of tools can do this as well.)</p>\n<p>If you haven&#39;t already, create a .gitignore at the root of your project to ignore the stuff we don&#39;t want to commit. Go ahead and put this in there:</p>\n<pre><code>node_modules\ndist/\n.env\n.DS_Store\ncoverage/\n.vscode/\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will make it so these things won&#39;t get added to our repo.
